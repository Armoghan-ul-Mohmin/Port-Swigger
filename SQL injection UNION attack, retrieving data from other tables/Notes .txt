Goal:  Perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user

--------------------------

Analysis:
==========
1. Check if the webapp contains sql injection vulnerability
2. Go to Gifts category.
3. Using FoxyProxy capture http request in Burp Suite.
4. Check for number of columns using '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL-- methord
5. now replace NULL with any string enclosed in quation marks and analize output
6. We need to get username and passwords from database so try: '+UNION+SELECT+username,password+FROM+users-- (Solved)


Solution:
=========
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter. 
2. Determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query and which columns contain text data. Verify that the query is returning two columns, both of which contain text, using a payload like the following in the category parameter:
							'+UNION+SELECT+'abc','def'--
3. Use the following payload to retrieve the contents of the users table:
							'+UNION+SELECT+username,+password+FROM+users--
4. Verify that the application's response contains usernames and passwords

Data Retrived from Database:
============================
