Goal:  perform an SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user

--------------------------

Analysis:
==========

1. Check If the Webapp is vulnerabil or not.
2. Try some common usernames and passwords. like admin or root as usernames and password or 12345678 as passwords.
3. Open Burp suite and catch the HTTP request using FoxyProxy.
4. Analize the request and send it to repeter.
5. Try to break th query using "admin '--" .
6. From the given goal we know that the username is administrator. So try to break the query by using correct username "administrator '--" 

Solution:
