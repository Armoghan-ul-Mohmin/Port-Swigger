Lab url: https://0a7700a303913388c0608ed2007d0005.web-security-academy.net/

Goal:  Perform an SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided

--------------------------

Analysis:
==========
1. Check if the webapp contains sql injection vulnerability
2. Go to Food & Drink category.
3. Using FoxyProxy capture http request in Burp Suite.
4. Check for number of columns using '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL-- methord
5. now replace NULL with any string enclosed in quation marks and analize output 
6. Now try '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'YBahsu',NULL-- (Solved)


Solution:
=========
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter. 
2. Determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. Verify that the query is returning three columns, using the following payload in the category parameter:
                            '+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--
3. Try replacing each null with the random value provided by the lab, for example:
                            '+UNION+SELECT+'abcdef',NULL,NULL--
4. If an error occurs, move on to the next null and try that instead
